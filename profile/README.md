# Crunch DOHA Islamic Finance 2025 and Beyond

## Introduction
The 11th Doha Islamic Finance Conference, scheduled for **April 8, 2025**, at the Ritz-Carlton in Doha, Qatar, is poised to be a landmark event in the evolution of Islamic finance. Likely the event referred to as "Crunch DOHA Islamic Finance 2025 and Beyond" by Aleksei Dolgikh, this conference is organized by [Bait Al Mashura Finance Consultations](https://b-mashura.com/) under the patronage of **H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani**, Qatar’s Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the theme **"Integration of Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of Islamic Finance,"** the conference aims to explore how advanced technologies can enhance the resilience and sustainability of Islamic financial systems. This article delves into the event’s significance, focusing on the roles of the **HAQQ Network**, **Islamic Coin (ISLM)**, and **Farcana FAR token**, as highlighted by Dolgikh.

## Event Overview
The Doha Islamic Finance Conference, established in 2010, is a premier platform for thought leaders, scholars, and industry practitioners to address challenges and opportunities in Islamic finance.

The conference will feature over 50 speakers and attract thousands of attendees, including representatives from government entities, financial institutions, and academic organizations. Its focus on blockchain and AI aligns with global trends in financial innovation, particularly in the Islamic finance sector, which is projected to surpass $3.69 trillion by 2024 ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/14/coindesk-indices-expands-into-mena-region-in-mou-with-islamic-coin)).

## Key Projects Highlighted

Its native cryptocurrency, **Islamic Coin (ISLM)** ([Islamic Coin](https://islamiccoin.net/)), is a deflationary digital asset that supports seamless transactions while adhering to Islamic principles. Key features include:

- **Shariah Compliance**: ISLM has received a Fatwa from leading Islamic finance authorities, ensuring alignment with Quranic teachings ([Islamic Coin Shariah](https://islamiccoin.net/shariah)).
- **Evergreen DAO**: 10% of newly minted ISLM tokens are allocated to a nonprofit virtual foundation for Islamic charities and projects, promoting community impact ([HAQQ Whitepaper](https://www.haqq.network/wp)).
- **Market Traction**: ISLM’s current price is approximately **$0.03526**, with a 24-hour trading volume of **$655,834** ([CoinMarketCap ISLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/islamic-coin/)). The project has over 1.5 million community members and raised over $200 million in private sales ([Crypto News](https://crypto.news/haqq-network-announces-expanding-islamic-web3-initiative-with-gold-token-and-rwa/)).

**Relevance to the Conference**:
- The conference’s blockchain focus makes HAQQ Network a central topic. **Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi**, co-founder of HAQQ Network and Islamic Coin, is a confirmed speaker, indicating that the project will be prominently featured ([Doha Islamic Finance Conference](https://ifcdoha.com/en/)).
- Sessions on Shariah-compliant digital assets are likely to highlight ISLM’s role in advancing financial inclusion for the global Muslim community, estimated at 1.8 billion ([Islamic Coin](https://islamiccoin.net/)).
- HAQQ’s partnerships, such as with CoinDesk Indices for Shariah-compliant benchmarks, underscore its influence in reshaping Islamic finance ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/14/coindesk-indices-expands-into-mena-region-in-mou-with-islamic-coin)).

### Farcana FAR Token
**Farcana** ([Farcana](https://www.farcana.com/)) is a blockchain-based 5v5 shooter game developed by Farcana Studio in the UAE, utilizing Unreal Engine 5. Its **FAR token** incentivizes player participation through a "Play-to-Hash" model, offering Bitcoin prize pools. Key features include:

- **Innovative Technology**: Farcana Labs develops AI solutions and wearables to enhance gaming experiences, aligning with the conference’s AI theme ([CoinMarketCap Farcana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/farcana/)).

**Relevance to the Conference**:
- Farcana’s blockchain technology is relevant to the conference’s theme, though its gaming focus makes it less directly tied to Islamic finance compared to HAQQ Network.
- **Ilman Shazhaev**, founder and CEO of Farcana, is listed as a speaker, suggesting potential discussions on blockchain applications in gaming or related sectors ([Doha Islamic Finance Conference](https://ifcdoha.com/en/)).
- The project’s innovative use of blockchain could serve as a case study for how decentralized technologies can create economic opportunities, potentially inspiring similar applications in Islamic finance.

## Implications for Islamic Finance
The conference’s focus on blockchain and AI reflects the growing importance of technology in Islamic finance. Projects like HAQQ Network demonstrate how blockchain can create Shariah-compliant financial instruments, while Farcana illustrates broader blockchain applications. The event’s discussions are likely to influence policy, innovation, and investment in the sector, fostering global dialogue among experts and decision-makers ([Gulf Times](https://www.gulf-times.com/article/702839/business/officials-global-experts-to-attend-11th-doha-islamic-finance-conference)).

## Conclusion
The 11th Doha Islamic Finance Conference, likely the "Crunch DOHA Islamic Finance 2025 and Beyond" event, is a pivotal platform for advancing Islamic finance through technology. HAQQ Network and Islamic Coin are at the forefront of Shariah-compliant blockchain solutions, with significant relevance to the conference’s theme. Farcana, while less directly related, highlights blockchain’s versatility. Aleksei Dolgikh’s coverage underscores the event’s importance in shaping the future of ethical finance.
